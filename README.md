## GRIP-TSF-Task 1: Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning

In this task,we have to predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based on the number of hours they studied.This task involves two variables.

For that we will be using one of the fundamental statistical and machine learning technique which is Simple Linear Regression.Linear regression uses the relationship between the data-points to draw a straight line through all them.This line can be used to predict future values.

## Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail

Problem Statement: Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’ This task is about Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail where the task focuses on a business manager who will try to find out weak areas where he can work to make more profit.

## Task 6: Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

Context:
For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, we create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

Tools: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
